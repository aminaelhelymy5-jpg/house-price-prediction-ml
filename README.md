# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Description
This project uses a Machine Learning model (Linear Regression) to predict house prices based on surface area and number of rooms.

## 🛠 Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

##  Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- surface: house surface area
- rooms: number of rooms
- price: house price (target)

##  Steps
1. Load the data from Excel
2. Separate features and target
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a Linear Regression model
5. Make predictions on new data
6. Visualize actual vs predicted prices

##  Result
The model is able to predict house prices on new data with reasonable accuracy.
